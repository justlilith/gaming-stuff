Eschew Materials (lvl 1 Sorceror feat, character lvl 4) {
	You can cast many spells without needing to utilize minor material components.

	Benefit: You can cast any spell with a material component costing 1 gp or less without needing that component. The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. If the spell requires a material component that costs more than 1 gp, you must have the material component on hand to cast the spell, as normal.

}

Weapon Finesse (Combat) (lvl 3 Rogue Feat, character lvl 3) {
	You are trained in using your agility in melee combat, as opposed to brute strength.

	Benefit: With a light weapon, elven curve blade, rapier, whip, or spiked chain made for a creature of your size category, you may use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls. If you carry a shield, its armor check penalty applies to your attack rolls.

	Special: Natural weapons are considered light weapons.

		Editor’s Note

		If I have Weapon Finesse, can I apply my Dex bonus to my combat maneuver checks instead of my Strength bonus?

		It depends on what combat maneuver you’re attempting. Disarm, sunder, and trip are normally the only kinds of combat maneuvers in which you’re actually using a weapon to perform the maneuver, and therefore the weapon’s bonuses apply to the roll. Therefore, if you’re attempting a disarm, sunder, or trip maneuver, you can apply your Dex bonus instead of your Str mod on the combat maneuver check (assuming you’re using a finessable weapon, of course). For other combat maneuvers, you use the normal rule for determining CMB ( Str instead of Dex).

		The Agile Maneuvers feat applies to all combat maneuvers, not just disarm, sunder, and trip, so it is still a useful option for a Dex-based creature that uses combat maneuvers.
