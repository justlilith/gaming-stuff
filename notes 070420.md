The battle continues from the last time we watched our heroes. Two WATER ELEMENTALS face them, and seem pretty OP tbh but we won't go there. Notable events include:

- ANZJA uses magic for the first time, which surprises T'LALOK. She misses, which does not surprise him.

- VIDER'S WOLK kills an ELEMENTAL. None of the party members realize it's VIDER'S WOLF, and simply seem to be happy _something_ is fighting on their side.

- AVIN summons an OCTOPUS to fight with the party. His name is STEVEN.

- TIYERI hops from HOPE over to T'LALOK's shoulders because they're slightly broader (and so HOPE can use magick).

- STEVEN shows himself to be a strong asset, and brings the WATER ELEMENTAL to the ground.

- Okay get a load of this -- VIDER musters an impressive amount of skill and lets loose a powerful arrow. It sinks towards his prey, with a rush of air and sound of death. The arrow impales the WATER ELEMENTAL and nails it to the wall, completely destroying it in the process. The sheer force cause the thing to  explode, sending STEVEN hurtling away and onto a certain green half-orc warrior. This surprises T'LALOK.

Meanwhile, MARILLA catches up to the UNDINE. "Why you running," she asks. "Can I have yo number? What's yo name? My little croissant."

He threatens her to stay back -- he explains the arrow shot by her friends
MARILLA offers to heal him, but he declines; he doesn't trust her. Instead, he tells her to follow him.

"So I _can_ have it?"

MARILLA follows the UNDINE to a new room. Within are another CRAB EIDOLON and a SHARKYBOI MERMAID AUTOMATON. He calls out to his sister, SENETHAR. MARIILA learns the UNDINE'S NAME is JORQUAL. He explains the situation to his sister. She slaps him across the face for interrupting her research over something so small.

MARILLA then learns from SENETHAR that KLARKOSH and the VISSK-THAR have been at war for such a long time. MARILLA asks for more info, but SENETHAR requests the rest of the party join first. She allows MARILLA to heal JORQUAL. MARILLA uses CURE MODERATE WOUNDS and it's super effective!

JORQUAL rejoins his sister. SENETHAR asks him where DIANA is; he doesn't know. The WATER MEPHIT joins them all and whispers to SENETHAR that DIANA is arriving soon.

AVIN jumps over the waterfall; STEVEN detaches from T'LALOK and follows. T'LALOK and ANZJA ask VIDER about the WOLF, but true to his nature, he ignores them. Instead, he and his WOLF head off down an unexplored hallway and see a massive shimmer in the corner; undoubtedly, it's a huge WATER ELEMENTAL lying in wait. He nopes the fuck out and retreats to the hallway with his WOLF. The WOLF is a good boye.

T'LALOK heals himself with a potion of CURE LIGHT WOUNDS. ANZJA notices and offers to heal him, but he declines. She offers to blast HOPES face with ropes of flame. HOPE is confused. ANZJA grins.

VIDER heads down the flooded passageway that MARILLA swam through earlier, where she shed her body. The ceiling slopes to meet the water, making passage impossible, so he nopes the fuck out and heads back to the party.

T'LALOK tells TIYERI to hang on tight, and dives over the waterfall.

Suddenly, a MUDLORD spawns in the level below! It fires at T'LALOK and engulfs AVIN. VIDER nails a shot at it. AVIN attacks it from within. T'LALOK does his best and also attacks. ANZJA manages to see the MUDLORD from above the waterfall, and attacks it from there.

Although the MUDLORD is a straight _boss_, it's susceptible to TRANSMUTE MAGIC. Despite this, none of the party casts spells of such nature. Interesting.

Meanwhile, MARILLA continues to speak with SENETHAR and JORQUAL. SENETHAR asks where the party is, but MARILLA bluffs. SENETHAR also asks if the portal water plane and the physical plane could be stabilized; MARILLA affirms. SENETHAR tells the WATER MEPHIT to find MARILLA'S HAPPY BAND.

Under the watchful eye of the fearsome GM... The campaign sails on.
