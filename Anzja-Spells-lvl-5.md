**Touch of Combustion** {
	source: [https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/touch-of-combustion/]

	School evocation [fire]; Level bloodrager 1, druid 1, inquisitor 1, magus 1, psychic 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1

	CASTING

	Casting Time 1 standard action
	Components V, S

	EFFECT

	Range touch
	Target creature or object touched
	Duration instantaneous
	Saving Throw Reflex negates; see text; Spell Resistance yes

	DESCRIPTION

	Your successful melee touch attack causes the target to ignite in a violent burst of flame, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage. If it fails its saving throw, the target also catches on fire. If the target catches fire, on the first round thereafter, creatures adjacent to it (including you) must each succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d4 points of fire damage.

**Charm Person** {
	source: [https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-person/]

	School enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; Level bard 1, psychic 1, shaman 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1; Domain charm 1; Subdomain slavery 1; Elemental School wood 1

	CASTING

	Casting Time 1 standard action
	Components V, S

	EFFECT

	Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
	Target one humanoid creature
	Duration 1 hour/level
	Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes

	DESCRIPTION

	This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target’s attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.

	The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person’s language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.

**Read Magic (cantrip, sorceror lvl 1)** {
	source: [https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-magic/]

	School divination; Level bard 0, cleric/oracle 0, druid 0, inquisitor 0, magus 0, psychic 0, shaman 0, sorcerer/wizard 0, summoner/unchained summoner 0, witch 0

	CASTING

	Casting Time 1 standard action
	Component: V, S

	EFFECT

	Range 60 ft.
	Area cone-shaped emanation
	Duration concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)
	Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no

	DESCRIPTION

	You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

	1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.

	2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.

	3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).

	Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

	Aura Strength: An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning spell level or an item’s caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

	Spell or Object	Aura Power
	Faint	Moderate	Strong	Overwhelming
	Functioning spell (spell level)	3rd or lower	4th-6th	7th-9th	10th+ (deity-level)
	Magic item (caster level)	5th or lower	6th-11th	12th-20th	21st+ (artifact)
	Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

	Original Strength	Duration of Lingering Aura
	Faint	1d6 rounds
	Moderate	1d6 minutes
	Strong	1d6x10 minutes
	Overwhelming	1d6 days
	Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

	Detect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

**Detect Magic (cantrip, sorceror lvl 1)** {
	source: [https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/read-magic/]

	School divination; Level antipaladin 1, bard 0, cleric/oracle 0, druid 0, inquisitor 0, magus 0, paladin 1, psychic 0, ranger 1, shaman 0, sorcerer/wizard 0, summoner/unchained summoner 0, witch 0

	CASTING

	Casting Time 1 standard action
	Components V, S, F (a clear crystal or mineral prism)

	EFFECT

	Range personal
	Target you
	Duration 10 min./level

	DESCRIPTION

	You can decipher magical inscriptions on objects – books, scrolls, weapons, and the like – that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a greater glyph of warding with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any symbol spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

	Read magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
