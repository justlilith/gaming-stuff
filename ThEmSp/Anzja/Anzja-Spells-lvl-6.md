#### Charm Person

Source: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-person/

School enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; Level bard 1, psychic 1, shaman 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1; Domain charm 1; Subdomain slavery 1; Elemental School wood 1

CASTING

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S

EFFECT

Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one humanoid creature
Duration 1 hour/level
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes

DESCRIPTION

This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target’s attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.

The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person’s language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.

#### Read Magic

*(cantrip, sorcerer lvl 1)*

Source: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-magic/

School divination; Level bard 0, cleric/oracle 0, druid 0, inquisitor 0, magus 0, psychic 0, shaman 0, sorcerer/wizard 0, summoner/unchained summoner 0, witch 0

CASTING

Casting Time 1 standard action
Component: V, S

EFFECT

Range 60 ft.
Area cone-shaped emanation
Duration concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no

DESCRIPTION

You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.

2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.

3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

Aura Strength: An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning spell level or an item’s caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

Spell or Object	Aura Power
Faint	Moderate	Strong	Overwhelming
Functioning spell (spell level)	3rd or lower	4th-6th	7th-9th	10th+ (deity-level)
Magic item (caster level)	5th or lower	6th-11th	12th-20th	21st+ (artifact)
Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

Original Strength	Duration of Lingering Aura
Faint	1d6 rounds
Moderate	1d6 minutes
Strong	1d6x10 minutes
Overwhelming	1d6 days
Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Detect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

#### Detect Magic (cantrip, sorcerer lvl 1)

Source: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/read-magic/

School divination; Level antipaladin 1, bard 0, cleric/oracle 0, druid 0, inquisitor 0, magus 0, paladin 1, psychic 0, ranger 1, shaman 0, sorcerer/wizard 0, summoner/unchained summoner 0, witch 0

CASTING

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, F (a clear crystal or mineral prism)

EFFECT

Range personal
Target you
Duration 10 min./level

DESCRIPTION

You can decipher magical inscriptions on objects – books, scrolls, weapons, and the like – that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a greater glyph of warding with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any symbol spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

Read magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

#### Prestidigitation

source: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prestidigitation

School universal; Level bard 0, magus 0, psychic 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

CASTING

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S

EFFECT

Range 10 ft.
Target, Effect, or Area see text
Duration 1 hour
Saving Throw see text; Spell Resistance no

DESCRIPTION

Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.

#### Message

source: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/message/

School transmutation [language-dependent]; Level bard 0, psychic 0, sorcerer/wizard 0, summoner/unchained summoner 0, witch 0; Elemental School air 0

CASTING

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, F (a piece of copper wire)

EFFECT

Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Targets one creature/level
Duration 10 min./level
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no

DESCRIPTION

You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies. Those nearby can hear these messages with a DC 25 Perception check. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path’s entire length lies within the spell’s range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning; it doesn’t transcend language barriers. To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper.
