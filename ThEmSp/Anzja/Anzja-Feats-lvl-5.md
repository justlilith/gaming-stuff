#### Eschew Materials

*(lvl 1 Sorcerer feat, character lvl 4)*

source: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/eschew-materials/

You can cast many spells without needing to utilize minor material components.

Benefit: You can cast any spell with a material component costing 1 gp or less without needing that component. The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. If the spell requires a material component that costs more than 1 gp, you must have the material component on hand to cast the spell, as normal.

#### Weapon Finesse (Combat)

*(lvl 3 Rogue Feat, character lvl 3)*

Source: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-finesse-combat

You are trained in using your agility in melee combat, as opposed to brute strength.

Benefit: With a light weapon, elven curve blade, rapier, whip, or spiked chain made for a creature of your size category, you may use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls. If you carry a shield, its armor check penalty applies to your attack rolls.

Special: Natural weapons are considered light weapons.

> If I have Weapon Finesse, can I apply my Dex bonus to my combat maneuver checks instead of my Strength bonus?
>
> It depends on what combat maneuver you’re attempting. Disarm, sunder, and trip are normally the only kinds of combat maneuvers in which you’re actually using a weapon to perform the maneuver, and therefore the weapon’s bonuses apply to the roll. Therefore, if you’re attempting a disarm, sunder, or trip maneuver, you can apply your Dex bonus instead of your Str mod on the combat maneuver check (assuming you’re using a finessable weapon, of course). For other combat maneuvers, you use the normal rule for determining CMB ( Str instead of Dex).
>
> The Agile Maneuvers feat applies to all combat maneuvers, not just disarm, sunder, and trip, so it is still a useful option for a Dex-based creature that uses combat maneuvers.

#### Xenoglossy

*(character lvl 5)*

Source: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/xenoglossy

People everywhere share a common tongue; they just don’t always remember it.

Prerequisite(s): Int 13, Linguistics 3 ranks.

Benefit(s): With a successful DC 25 Linguistics check, you can speak with a single individual with whom you share no common languages. You cannot take 10 on this check, nor can anyone aid you. You believe you are speaking your native language, and the listener believes you are speaking its native language; however, to everyone else able to hear you, you sound like you are speaking gibberish. Creatures that have truespeech or that are under the effects of tongues can understand Xenoglossy, and other creatures who succeed at a DC 25 Linguistics check can pick up the gist of what you are saying.

Xenoglossy lasts for the length of the conversation or for 1 minute per level, whichever is shorter. You can use Xenoglossy again to continue a longer conversation, and you gain a +2 on Linguistics checks to use Xenoglossy to communicate with someone with whom you previously communicated using this feat. If you fail a Xenoglossy check, you can’t use the Xenoglossy feat to attempt further communication with that creature until you gain additional ranks in Linguistics.
